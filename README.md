Funtion to try different classification algorithm 

Define a function to fit machine learning algorithms:
Since many of the algorithms we will use are from the sklearn library, they all take similar (practically the same) inputs and produce similar outputs.

To prevent writing code multiple times, we will functionise fitting the model and returning the accuracy scores.
